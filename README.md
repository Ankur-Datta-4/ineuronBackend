# ineuronBackend

## About

This is a repo, containing the backend REST API code, which was developed during the ineuron-hackathon


## About the project
The problem statement we chose was about ticket management and tracking, in edTech. Which includes that:
1. A ticket can be raised by a student, and get doubts/problems resolved by teachers
2. If the teacher is present, the issue would be directly sent in the form of a chat
3. If the teacher is not present, the issue would be converted to a ticket and shown in a dashboard

## Progress

[X] Real-time chat support
[X] Ticket as a kanban board
[X] Ticket dashboard as a table 
[ ] Final Testing
